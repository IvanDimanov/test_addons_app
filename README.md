# Test Addons App

![Stack Schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IvanDimanov/test_addons_app/master/notes/schema.png)

The point of this app is me having fun combining together some of the Best frameworks at the time.
If you want to have it for a spin and play with **ES2015**, **Marionette**, webpack and all the rest in the stack but do not what to start from scratch:

1. Edit **/config/default_config.json**
2. Prepare your DB
3. Run
```
npm run initial-build
```
... and enjoy yourself :star2:
